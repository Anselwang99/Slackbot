# Installing node and npm via nvm

If you do not have nvm installed, please install it using:

```
brew install nvm
```

Let's install node 18.16.0 now

```
nvm install 18.16.0
nvm use 18.16.0
```

Ensure that node 18.16.0 is now being used:
```
node --version
```
It should output: v18.16.0

# Install other dependencies:

Install nodemon:
```
npm i -g nodemon
```

# Run the app

Run the app on port 3000 by:
```
npm i
npm run dev
```

# HTTP-tunneling using ngrok

We need to do http-tunneling into the slack app backend running currently on localhost:
```
ngrok http 3000
```
You should get some ngrok subdomain which http-tunnels into localhost:3000. This makes the slack app backend running locally on port 3000 accessible to internet on that particular ngrok domain. Let's say the ngrok domain is https://f676-2402-e280-21c9-88-4111-37ec-6c17-9e51.ngrok-free.app

# Update the app manifest
Go to api.slack.com. Find the app that you earlier created. Go to app manifest. Replace the manifest over there with the one in this file: slack-config/manifest.json. Remember to replace the request url appropriately. Right now, it is https://f676-2402-e280-21c9-88-4111-37ec-6c17-9e51.ngrok-free.app/event. Suppose that the ngrok url that you got is https://abc-def.ngrok.io. So, you should replace the existing manifest like this: https://abc-def.ngrok.io/event

Once done, reinstall the app in your workspace and verify the url.
